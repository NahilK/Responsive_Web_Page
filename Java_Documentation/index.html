    <p>Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java. This reference will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Java Programming language.</p>

    <header> Why to Learn Java</header>
    <p>Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Java Programming:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Object Oriented</strong> − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Platform Independent</strong> − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simple</strong>− Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secure</strong> − With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Architecture-neutral</strong> − Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Portable </strong>− Being architecturarchitecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Robust</strong> − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.

</li>
       
      </ul>

    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

  </section>
    
    
    
  <section id="Java_Environment_SetUp" class="main-section">
    <header> Java Environment SetUp</header>
    <p>If you are still willing to set up your environment for Java programming language, then this section guides you on how to download and set up Java on your machine. Following are the steps to set up the environment.</p>

<p>Java SE is freely available from the link Download Java. You can download a version based on your operating system.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions to download Java and run the .exe to install Java on your machine. Once you installed Java on your machine, you will need to set environment variables to point to correct installation directories</p>

    <header> Java Basic Syntax</header>
    <p>
    When we consider a Java program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what do class, object, methods, and instance variables mean.</p>

    </section>
  
    
  <section id="Java_Constructors" class="main-section">
  <header> Java Constructors</header>
   <p>A constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method. However, constructors have no explicit return type.</p>

<p>Typically, you will use a constructor to give initial values to the instance variables defined by the class, or to perform any other start-up procedures required to create a fully formed object.</p>

<p>All classes have constructors, whether you define one or not, because Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes all member variables to zero. However, once you define your own constructor, the default constructor is no longer used.</p>
    <p>Following is the syntax of a constructor −</p>
    <code>
      class ClassName {
   ClassName() {
   }
}
    </code>
  </section>  
    
    
    
    
  <section id="Java_Numbers" class="main-section">
  <header> Java Numbers</header>
   <p>Normally, when we work with Numbers, we use primitive data types such as byte, int, long, double, etc.</p>
     <code>
  int i = 5000;
float gpa = 13.65f;
double mask = 125;
    </code>
  </section>  
    
  <section id="Java_Arrays" class="main-section">
  <header> Java Arrays</header>
   <p>To use an array in a program, you must declare a variable to reference the array, and you must specify the type of array the variable can reference. Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable −</p>
    
    <code>
 dataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.
or
dataType arrayRefVar[];  // works but not preferred way.
    </code>
  </section>  
    
  <section id="Java_Streams" class="main-section">
  <header> Java Streams</header>
   <p>Java byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. Though there are many classes related to byte streams but the most frequently used classes are, FileInputStream and FileOutputStream. Following is an example which makes use of these two classes to copy an input file into an output file −</p>
    
    <code>
 import java.io.*;
public class CopyFile {

   public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {  
      FileInputStream in = null;
      FileOutputStream out = null;

      try {
         in = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
         out = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
         
         int c;
         while ((c = in.read()) != -1) {
            out.write(c);
         }
      }finally {
         if (in != null) {
            in.close();
         }
         if (out != null) {
            out.close();
         }
      }
   }
}
    </code>
  </section>  
    
  <section id="Java_Strings" class="main-section">
  <header> Java Strings</header>
   <p>Normally, when we work with Numbers, we use primitive data types such as byte, int, long, double, etc.</p>
    
    <code>
      public class StringDemo {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      char[] helloArray = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '.' };
      String helloString = new String(helloArray);  
      System.out.println( helloString );
   }
}
